      <p>Among the many side dishes that grace a Sri Lankan table, <strong>tempered potatoes</strong>, known locally as <em>Ala Thel Dala</em>, hold a special place. This humble dish of sautéed potatoes is infused with mustard seeds, turmeric, onions, curry leaves, and green chillies — a perfect example of how everyday ingredients become something irresistible in Sri Lankan cooking. Lightly spiced yet full of character, it's often enjoyed with rice, roti, or even sandwiched inside a slice of bread for a quick snack.</p>

      <p>Simple to prepare but deeply satisfying, tempered potatoes capture the essence of Sri Lankan home cooking — bold, fragrant, and comforting all at once. It’s a dish that celebrates the island’s love of spice, its warmth, and the joy of sharing food around the table.</p>

        <h3>For the temper</h3>

          <li>1½–2 tbsp (30–40 ml) coconut or vegetable oil</li>
          <li>1 medium red onion, peeled and finely sliced</li>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the potatoes in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Add the turmeric and salt. Bring to boil, then turn down to simmer and cook for 15–20 minutes, until the potatoes are just tender enough to insert a fork. Drain well.</li>

        <li>In a large frying pan over a high heat, heat the 2 tablespoons of oil. When the oil is simmering, add the potatoes. With a fork, gently press down on each potato, breaking the skin and smashing them a bit. You don’t want to break them up, just smash them up a little. Cook for 2–3 minutes and when they are nice and golden brown, turn each potato over. When they are brown on both sides, transfer to a bowl while you make the temper.</li>

        <li>Pour 2 tablespoons of oil into the frying pan. When hot, add the onion and cook until it starts to go translucent. Add the curry leaves, garlic, green chilli, Maldive fish and pandan leaf, if using. Stir-fry for 2–3 minutes, until the curry leaves are bright green. Add the chilli powder or dried red chillies, mustard seeds and add a little more oil if necessary to keep everything bright and moving. After 1–2 minutes, when the seeds start to pop, return the potatoes to the pan and stir through, coating thoroughly in the spicy mixture. Finish with a squeeze of lime juice.</li>
