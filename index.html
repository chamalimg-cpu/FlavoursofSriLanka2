				<h2>What Sri Lankan Food is about</h2>
				<p>Sri Lankan cuisine is a vibrant blend of flavours, colours, and aromas that reflect the island’s rich cultural heritage and diverse influences. 
                    Rooted in centuries of tradition, it combines indigenous ingredients such as coconut, rice, and spices with culinary elements introduced through trade and colonisation by the Portuguese, Dutch, and British. 
                    Each region of the island offers its own unique variations, making Sri Lankan food both diverse and deeply connected to local culture and geography. 
                <br><br> 
                 At the heart of Sri Lankan cuisine is rice and curry — a staple meal featuring steamed rice served with an assortment of curries made from 
                    vegetables, legumes, meat, or seafood. The liberal use of spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cumin, and chili creates complex layers of flavour, 
                    while coconut milk adds richness and balance. Sambols, such as the fiery pol sambol (a coconut and chili mix), and mallum, a shredded green salad, 
                    are often served alongside to enhance the meal with freshness and heat.
                  <br><br>                    
                 Beyond its famous curries, Sri Lanka is known for a wide range of traditional dishes and snacks. Hoppers (bowl-shaped rice flour pancakes), string hoppers (steamed rice noodles), 
                    and kottu roti (chopped flatbread stir-fried with vegetables and meat) showcase the creativity and adaptability of Sri Lankan cooking. Sweet treats like kokis, aluwa, and watalappan 
                    highlight the island’s love for coconut, jaggery, and fragrant spices. Altogether, Sri Lankan cuisine offers a harmonious balance of flavour, nutrition, and tradition — a true reflection 
                    of the island’s rich cultural mosaic.
